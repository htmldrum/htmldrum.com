summary: It's Christmas Day and I'm at work.

Today is Christmas Day, 2010 and I'm sitting at work waiting for a cluster of VMware nodes to reboot and manually resetting the internal routing tables for the NSW APs. Got an email this morning at 3 saying that if it wasn't fixed, we'd have issues for customers on Christmas Day. Further, if I didn't finish asset classes before the half-year end we'd have problems with statutory reporting.

In years past I'd be eating a snag in a little blow-up pool in my backyard, progressively getting more sauced. However this year I'm onto my second cup of coffee before lunch.

I just wrote this post to say never again.
