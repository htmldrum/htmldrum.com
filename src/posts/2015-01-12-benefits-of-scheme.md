Over the Christmas holidays I was able to play around with a lot of languages. I've read all of the "7-in-7" series from [PragPub](https://pragprog.com/) and the one language they seem to skip over is Scheme. In college, I loved Scheme because of its familiarity to the language I do most of my thinking in: JavaScript.

Scheme and Common Lisp are the two principal dialects of the computer programming language Lisp. Unlike Common Lisp, however, Scheme follows a minimalist design philosophy that specifies a small standard core accompanied by powerful tools for language extension.

Scheme was created during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab and released by its developers, Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman, via a series of memos now known as the Lambda Papers. It was the first dialect of Lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization, giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms. It was also one of the first programming languages to support first-class continuations. It had a significant influence on the effort that led to the development of Common Lisp.

Some people say Scheme's greatest strength is as a teaching language. While it is very beneficial to learn functional programming (it's an entirely new way of thinking) another benefit in learning scheme is that it is also "pure". Sure it can't do a ton of stuff like java, but that's also what's great about it, it's a language made entirely of parentheses, alphanumeric characters, and a mere handful other punctuations.

In my intro course, we are taught Java, and I see lots of my friends struggling with 'public static void main' even though that's not the point of the program and how the profs have no choice but to 'handwave' it until they're more advanced. You don't see that in Scheme.

If you really want to learn what Scheme can do in a piece of cake that is really hard to implement in languages like Java, I suggest looking at [this](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-12.html#%_sec_1.3)
