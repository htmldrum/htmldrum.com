Got these today:

{% highlight bash %}$ svn ci -m "Updating repo" .
svn: E155004: Working copy '/mnt/restore/var/siteupdate/svn/adelson' locked
svn: E200031: sqlite: attempt to write a readonly database {% endhighlight %}

Over the weekend, a co-worker updated our SVN repo's for a legacy application from 1.6 to 1.7. Through that process, he ran:

{% highlight bash %}ls repo_directory | xargs `svn upgrade`{% endhighlight %}

The default behaviour of this script changed the permissions on all child files of the repo, so when I came along and tried to check in changes, I got the permissions issues on the `.svn` files for each repo and the system-wide `/var/svn/libs/db/rep-cache.db` changes required through the SQLite dependency.

TL;DR 
-----
Check the user and group permissions on the .db files for the repo (in `.svn/wc.db`) and server-wide (in `/var/svn/libs/db/rep-cache.db`) and ensure that your user and group has the perms required to write to them.
