The success of the data center floor plan design process is dependent on the participation of the facility design team and the information technology design team. The facility design team will consist of the building architect and the electrical, mechanical, and structural engineers. The information technology design team will consist of those responsible for the network topology, server and storage platform architecture, and network cabling infrastructure design. The design of the data center layout must be developed with input from all the key stakeholders from the facility and IT groups within the organization. This integrated design approach will help to ensure that the data center will function and perform throughout the facility life cycle, providing operational efficiency to support the many technology life cycles that the data center facility will see.

Generally there are only 2 classes of rack: two- and four-post racks:
  - Two-post racks have typically been used in network IDF/ MDF closets where there is a single row of equipment. The two-post rack should only be used in the data center where space constraints limit the use of four-post racks or cabinets. ITE that are mounted in two-post racks are more susceptible to physical damage as the ITE is exposed beyond the rack frame.
  - A four-post rack provides a front and back rail to which the ITE is mounted on. Manufacturers provide four-post rack models that offer fixed-position front and back rails or a fixed-position front rail with a variable-position back rail if required. The variable-position back rail typically is adjustable as a single system from top to bottom, so all ITE mounted in the rack must accommodate the rail position selected.
