## Abstract
Playing around with Go, I wanted to build an abstraction layer around the
abc news website. I, like most people, spend way too much time booting up
a browser and navigating news articles. I wanted to cut the browser out of
the equation and try a project with a compiled high level language.

## Design
`go` was chosen as the implementation language to gain familiarity with its build
system and debugging tools. `rust` was also considered but I want to save it
for a language interpeter project as its use of Intermediate Representation
is its most interesting feature. Currently thinking about a DSL that allows
users to operate on the LLVM IR while the process is sleeping.

Next, I drew the following thought cloud to explore solutions. This low effort
approach is useful in exploring a large problem space in a short amount of time.

Things that popped out were:
- REST
- Data sourcing
- Media type parsing and formatting

After doing some searching around [`abc.net.au/services`](http://www.abc.net.au/services/), it seemed that there
were many services - more than just what I cared about.

These 'services' were an amalgamation of:
- RSS feeds for
  - podcasts - http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/feed/6490346/podcast.xml
  - news articles
- Blog aggregators
- Registration endpoints
- Third party service provider endpoint aggregators
  - [Facebook](http://www.abc.net.au/services/youtube/)
  - [Youtube](http://www.abc.net.au/services/facebook/)
- 'Enterprise' ABC services
  - [Content Sales](http://www.abccontentsales.com.au/)
  - [Costume Hire](http://www.abc.net.au/abcresourcehire/costume/)
  - [Music Publishing](http://abcmusicpublishing.com.au/)

In reading this 'services' listing I was reminded of an opinionated blog post
that forms the archetype for many discussions I have with publishing asset
holders: [REST API's must be hypertext-driven](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven).
It's loud, and makes a lot of points but some key ideas are:
### "hypertext is a constraint"
- conflicting representations for company assets:
  - presented without interpretation => frustrated choices for consumers
  - editorial unclear vision for audience
    - hard to match content to audience
  - hard to relate incongruent types
    - richness of media content left unexplored
  - because media is embodied as operations, not as a machine that
    interprets operations

### "hypertext as the engine of application state"
Many institutions are not able to ride technical change
  - assets locked into coupling with generational garbage
  - hard to sepparate asset and garbage
  - hard describe asset and only asset in way that preserves effort
  - not able to cleanly port assets and language-independent workflows to
    new technological implementations
    - turing equivalence => we need to be doing better here
    - metaobject protocols

### "focus on media types used for representing resources"
- A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort
      in defining the media type(s) used for representing resources and
      driving application state, or in defining extended relation names
      and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard media types.
      Any effort spent describing what methods to use on what URIs of
      interest should be entirely defined within the scope of the processing
      rules for a media type (and, in most cases, already defined by
      existing media types).
      [Failure here implies that out-of-band information is driving
      interaction instead of hypertext.]
  - disagee: no hierarchical compling
  - REST API requires no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI
  - Media companies are not in the business of defining resource interactions,
    technical media managers need to be aware when technical activities
    are in the business of defining interactions or describing resource
    and maintaining contracts around them
- Media companies spend their time better by defining media types and working
  in open source interest groups pooling their resources

## Metaobject Heiarchy for ABC

- Service Provider

  - YouTube
- Media type
  - Article
    - `http://schema.org/NewsArticle`
    - Model definitinon
      - Incomplete source - not all fields in response
      - Incomplete domain - not all fields are what we want to tag and search
  - Blog - https://schema.org/Blog

  - ... Not interested. If you want to reach out, I can give you some time.
  - rss feed for news
  - rss feed for podcasts
  - HTML list of blogs - could be an rss feed
  - HTML form to subscribe to newsletters
1. RSS Feeds - scrape by subject and aggregate
  - Schema: http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html
2. Fetch/Index:
  - By Subject (politics, sport)
  - By Network (rn, local, online)
  - Their categorisation really didn't make any sense
    - Blowing away their index, reindexing by 'category'
  - Subject: lowercase
  - Network: Uppercase
3. Each rss feed has a list of entries
4. Each entry may be viewed, next, prev'd
5. Spawn server, have clients request xml, json, rpc
