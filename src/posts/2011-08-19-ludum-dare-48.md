In 56 minutes I'll be starting Ludum Dare 48 - a programming competition where I have to write a complete application from a theme within 48 hours. The theme will not be revealed until the timer has started. I'm starting to get psyched for this.

I originally wanted to program something in Java, however I don't feel that I have either the time or resources to complete such a task. Instead I'll stick to AS3 - it's like Java with training wheels and has some great packaging options.

I want to write something that I can play with Amanda so I think I'll write it as an Actionscript 3 Mobile Package so I can use Flex 4.5's .IPA packager. Without having too much else planned, I think she'd enjoy a puzzler that involves animals.- The rest of the contents is up to the theme...wish me luck!
